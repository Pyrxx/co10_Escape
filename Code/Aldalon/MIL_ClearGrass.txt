MIL_ClearGrass allows players create firelanes through grass or to simply clear small patches of grass to give unobstructed observation.
"Land_ClutterCutter_small_F" is used to clear the grass, and when clearing patches is spawned 50cm in front of the player.
Be aware, it can be a bit fiddly sometimes to get the right spot to remove patches of grass.

Features:

- AddActions to clear a small patch of grass, or clear a point-to-point line through grass.
- Mission designers can choose to enable/disable clearing of both patches and/or firelanes.
- Mission designers can also add a required item to be in the player's inventory to be able to clear any grass.

To use:	

- Copy the file MIL_ClearGrass.sqf to your mission folder.
- Run the script using:
	- nul = [_availableActions,_itemsRequired] execVM "MIL_ClearGrass.sqf";
		- _availableActions - number (optional)
				    - default: 0
				    - determine what grass clearing option can be used
					- 0 - both
					- 1 - clear grass patch
					- 2 - clear fire lane
		- _itemsRequired - array of strings (optional)
				 - default: []
				 - classNames of any items required to clear any grass

Example:

- nul = [] execVM "MIL_ClearGrass.sqf";
	- Players will be able to use both actions without restrictions.
- nul = [1,["ACE_EntrenchingTool"]] execVM "MIL_CAS.sqf";
	- Players will only be able to clear patches of grass any need to have an ACE Entrenching Tool in their inventory.
